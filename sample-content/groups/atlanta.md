They got a place down Kentucky
Right down near Ohio
Where you can watch the planes at night
People line up to watch each flight
I said watchin' them planes
I wish I was on one
I'm sittin' here thinkin' 'bout my red head dream
If I could only see her tonight
Oh Atlanta, Oh Atlanta!
I said yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Atlanta, got to get back to you
Well you can drop me off on Peachtree
I got to feel that Georgia sun
And the women there in Atlanta
They make you awfully glad you come
I said watchin' them planes
I wish I was on one
I'm sittin' here thinking 'bout my crazy dream
If I could only be there tonight
Oh Atlanta, Oh Atlanta!
I said yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Atlanta, got to get back to you
We make a day and how just you and me
But the music plays all night
They got the boogie band blowin' that's bound for hell
And when they get to movin' they never stop
You just keep on playin' that down home beat
You just keep on layin' it down hot
I wish I was on one
I'm sittin' here thinkin' bout my red haired dream
If I could only see her tonight
Oh Atlanta, Oh Atlanta!
I said yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Atlanta, got to get back to you
