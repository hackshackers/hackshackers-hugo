This week, journalists chortled over tronc&#8217;s &#8220;[deadly swarm of buzzwords][1],&#8221; watched the U.S. Congress [livestream over Periscope][2] and [traded tips and tools][3] after a record-setting IRE conference. Let&#8217;s see what hacks and hackers are getting up to next week.

But first, consider taking a minute to answer [OpenNews&#8217;s survey][4] on how they can help journalists and technologists better expand their networks and collaborate. Knight and Mozilla partner with a lot of Hacks/Hackers folks, and dedicate a lot of time and money to making these kinds of projects accessible to hacks and hackers across the world.

  * Brisbane is discussing the [future of radio][6]
  * Rosario is learning [search engine hacks][7]
  * [Miami][8] and [IRE][9] are holding their regular weekly open labs

**Chapter spotlight:**

[Austin, Texas][10], held a [session last week][11] on UX design. Co-organizer [Becca Aaronson][12] said her own outlet, The Texas Tribune, shared its techniques but also invited others to share, as a way to get the group more engaged.

> &#8220;We had a &#8216;bad idea&#8217; party, and everyone shared the worst possible ideas to improve news websites. It included everything from endless pop-ups to sites that make your phone explode, literally. The bad idea party got people laughing, and open to do creative thinking. It was a fun way to bring the group together, and everyone could actively participate.&#8221;
