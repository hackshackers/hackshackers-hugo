[Truth and Trust Online](http://truthandtrustonline.com) started as a series of private meetings in London in 2019 between a number of researchers and other policy professionals on the trustworthiness of online information and digital spaces on the internet.

The series of private meetings became an annual conference and a unique collaboration between practitioners, technologists, academics and platforms, to discuss, and collaborate on useful technical innovations and research in the space.

The first edition on of the Truth and Trust Online conference was held in 2019 in London. It was held online in 2020 and will come back for a third year in 2021, online, on October 7 and 8.

Despite being a new conference, TTO 2019 was attended by around 300 participants from industry and academia, TTO 2020 was hosted online. It drew an even larger audience of more than 400 participants. Both conferences were sponsored by major industrial partners (such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, Microsoft, Amazon, Bloomberg, Intel etc.), published high-quality [contributed papers](https://truthandtrustonline.com/proceedings/) and had a [compelling line-up](https://truthandtrustonline.com/speakers-2019-2/) of invited speakers.

To mention a few: Jerome Pesenti (VP of AI at Facebook), Cristian Canton Ferrer (Head of Facebook's AI Red Team), Rasmus Nielsen (Director at Reuters Institute), Claire Wardle (Director at First Draft), Judy King (Director at BBC monitoring), Will Moy (CEO at Full Fact) and a number of distinguished panelists from organizations such as the WHO, Wikimedia Foundation, US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, and Harvard Medical School.
