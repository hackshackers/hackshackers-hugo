Do you want to start a new group, join an existing group, or just get more involved in general? Fantastic! Here, we compiled a list of resources as well as some crowdsourced tips from other organizers.

**If you’re rebooting a group or starting a new one&#8230;**

  * Check out the [rules and recommendations for new groups][1]
  * Read our [list of suggested meetups](https://hackshackers.com/resources/suggested-meetups/)
  * Or Hacks/Hackers Africa's [list of potential meetups][9]
  * Erika Owens in Philadelphia published [a list of suggestions][10] for organizers
  * Cindy Royal in Austin shared [tips for a successful hackathon](https://hackshackers.com/resources/hackathon-tips/)
  * Download and customize [official logos](https://hackshackers.com/resources/logos/) for your group
  * Pose a question on the [Google Group for organizers][2]
  * Try holding intermittent or quarterly events (quality over quantity!)
  * Instead of planning a group-wide event, plan a dinner or outing for you and your co-organizers
  * [Email us](mailto:contact@hackshackers.com) if you have any questions, or just want to brainstorm
  * If you need some startup money, let us know. We might have some money (not much) we can funnel to startup groups, but $50 can go a long way in a bar toward appetizers

**If you want to get more involved…**

  * Subscribe to [the weekly newsletter][6]
  * Join our [open call][5] the first Wednesday of every month
  * Join the [Slack channel][8]

**If you want to grow your group&#8230;**

  * London shared their template for [organizer roles and responsibilities][11] (warning: link will download a Word doc), and [task assignment worksheet][12] (Word doc)
  * Try finding sponsors by making a verbal announcement at your meetup or reaching out to potential sponsors by email
  * Make a venue database for your city, so that you (and future organizers) have a place to refer back to
