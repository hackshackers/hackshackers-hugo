[Rich Gordon][1], co-founder, is associate professor and director of digital innovation at the [Medill School of Journalism][2], where he launched the school’s graduate program in new media journalism. He has spent most of his career exploring the areas where journalism and technology intersect. As a reporter and editor, he was an early adopter of technological tools to analyze data for journalistic purposes. At The Miami Herald, he was among the first generation of journalists to lead online publishing efforts at newspapers. At Medill, he has developed courses through which students have explored digital content and communities and developed new forms of storytelling taking advantage of interactive media. He has also served as director of new communities for the Northwestern Media Management Center, where he researched the impact of online communities on journalism and publishing. In 2007, Rich won a Knight News Challenge grant allowing Medill to offer full scholarships for journalism master&#8217;s degrees to people with computer programming experience.

[Aron Pilhofer][5], co-founder, is editor of Interactive News Technologies at [The New York Times][6], overseeing a news-focused team of journalist/developers who build dynamic, data-driven applications to enhance The Times&#8217; reporting online. He also is co-founder of DocumentCloud, Knight Foundation-funded organization designed to improve journalism by making original source documents easy to find, share, read and collaborate on. He joined The Times in 2005 as a projects editor on the paper&#8217;s newly expanded computer-assisted reporting team, where he specialized in stories related to money, politics and influence for the politics desk and Washington bureau. Prior to that, Pilhofer was database editor at the Center for Public Integrity in Washington, where he began an ongoing project in 2002 to track a new form of political non-profit organization. The Center&#8217;s reporting was among the first to highlight the hole in campaign finance regulations that allows these groups to pump hundreds of millions into elections. Earlier, Pilhofer was on the national training staff of Investigative Reporters and Editors and worked for a number of years as a statehouse and projects reporter for Gannett newspapers in New Jersey and Delaware.

[Chrys Wu][19], organizer, is a journalist and user engagement strategist who began her career as a motorcycle-riding, magazine-editing Web pioneer. She now works with businesses interested in deepening their connection to their audiences through research, community-building strategy and user-centric design. Her early work online gave rise to some of the Web&#8217;s first hand-crafted home pages and databases. Since then, she has launched sites and projects for LATimes.com, NYTimes.com, KCRW.com and WNYC.org, among others. Her community-building strategy work crosses online, mobile and real-world boundaries and helps people with common interests be more connected. She was honored to be a judge for the 2009-2010 Knight News Challenge and an outreach consultant for the 2010-2011 Knight News Challenge. In addition to news and technology, Chrys’s passions include architectural photography, cultural philanthropy, food, fencing (the sport, not the crime) and fashion. She’s active on Twitter [@MacDiva][20] and shares bookmarks on [Pinboard][21]. (Old school, but we like that about her.)
