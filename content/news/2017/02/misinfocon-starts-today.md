Happy Friday, hacks and hackers! We hope to see you this weekend at [MisinfoCon][1] or next week at [NICAR][2]. If not, you can follow along at [#MisinfoCon][3] and [#NICAR17][4].

{{< tweet 834076194593206273 >}}

In the meantime, [Billy Penn][5] and the Knight Foundation are putting together a mobile journalism playbook and they&#8217;d like your input. Billy Penn audience development manager [Angie Nassar][6] said it will be a practical guide for journalists, including tools, tips and best practices.

> &#8220;We’re looking for people from newsrooms everywhere to interview. We want to find out what’s working for you, what’s not, and how we can learn from each other.&#8221;

[Send Angie an email][7] if you&#8217;d like to contribute.

**The week ahead:**

  * Hacks/Hackers is holding its [global open call][8]
  * Hacks/Hackers is also sponsoring a [lunch for NICAR17][9] attendees
  * Brisbane is discussing ways to [safely store][10] digital properties
  * Warsaw is talking about [verifying and visualizing][11] data
  * Taipei is holding a workshop on [immersive storytelling][12]
  * IRE is holding its [weekly open lab][13]

**Group spotlight:**

Instead of zooming in on a local group, we&#8217;re going to give the Hacks/Hackers global team a little sunshine this week. [Jenny 8 Lee][14] and [Phillip Smith][15] put together a doozy of [a conference this weekend][1], and Phillip has been compiling suggested reading for weeks.

[Samantha Sunne][16] and [Burt Herman][17] will be hosting the regular [global open call][8] next week, on Wednesday at 4pm GMT (look up your [local time here][18]). Samantha will also be at NICAR hosting a [lunch for local organizers][19]. Show the global team some love and say hi at any of these events!
