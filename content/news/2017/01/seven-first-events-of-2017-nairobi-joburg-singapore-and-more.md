Happy Friday, hacks and hackers. After a winter hibernation (or summer nap, for those in the southern hemisphere), seven Hacks/Hackers groups are holding their first events of 2017, including in Asia, Europe, North America and Africa.

{{< tweet 822329676311961600 >}}

**The week ahead:**

  * Nairobi is [looking at tools][1] that help indentify fake news
  * Johannesburg is [digitizing][2] legal documents
  * Singapore is [learning to make][3] &#8220;code art&#8221; with D3
  * London is [hearing about projects][4] at the BBC and Al Jazeera
  * Los Angeles is hosting a [get-together][5] with ONA LA
  * New York is holding a [workshop][6] on building web notifications
  * [IRE][7] in Missouri is holding its weekly open lab

**Group spotlight:**

Earlier this week, [Rio de Janeiro][8] invited Nick Denton, the founder of Gawker Media, to come [speak to the group][9]. This was organizer [Gabriela Mafort][10]&#8216;s first time putting together a Hacks/Hackers event, and she said having a well-known speaker helped get the word out. &#8220;Having Nick Denton as our first speaker was a great incentive to move forward!&#8221;
