Welcome to another Friday, hacks and hackers! We&#8217;ve got a bigger announcement than usual this week:

{{< tweet 824347511439720449 >}}

Several Hacks/Hackers organizers, including Jenny 8. Lee, Burt Herman and Phillip Smith, have launched an anti-fake news event called [MisinfoCon][1] in Boston. It&#8217;s coming up in one short month, so put it on your calendar and tell your colleagues.

**The week ahead:**

  * Warsaw is holding [a Q&A][2] with some of the biggest news outlets in Poland
  * New York is holding a [workshop][3] on how to build web notifications
  * Brisbane is planning more events in a pub and is therefore meeting for an event aptly titled [Planning in a Pub][4]
  * Portland is holding an informal [brainstorming session][5]
  * Singapore is [collaborating][6] on a &#8216;privilege calculator&#8217; project
  * [Miami][7] and [IRE][8] are holding their regular weekly open labs

**Group spotlight:**

Last week, [Singapore][9] met for [an event called][10] &#8220;A Study in Moire: Code Art with D3 / Greensock.&#8221; Organizer [Rebecca Pazos][11] said the group recently committed to meet the third Monday of every month, in an attempt to organize themselves and build their community better.

> &#8220;Plus for our own sanity as co-organisers it can be difficult to find the time to organise, so setting ourselves a &#8216;deadline&#8217; has helped us to stay focused and not over-commit.&#8221;
