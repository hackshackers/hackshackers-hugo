Hacks/Hackers has surpassed the 10,000 member mark just two and half years after its start as a Meetup group in the Bay Area. Due to the passion of journalists and technologists like you, we now have groups holding regular events on four continents. And the >10,000 members on meetup.com don&#8217;t even reflect the new groups being created in parts of the world that aren&#8217;t using Meetup.com for organization, such as in Africa and the Middle East.

People have found jobs, co-founders for startups, acquirers for their company, learned new skills, hacked out projects, shown off their work and so much more at Hacks/Hackers events. We want to celebrate your achievements as we look to the future and doing so much more. Please send Tweets, photos, Facebook updates or any other media with a story about what you&#8217;ve gotten out of Hacks/Hackers using the hashtag #10kHacksHackers and we&#8217;ll add it to the Storify story below.
