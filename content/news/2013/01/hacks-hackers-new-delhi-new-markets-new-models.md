Hacks/Hackers New Delhi, the first Hacks/Hackers group in India, launched Dec. 5. About 50 journalists, techies and supporters came by [What&#8217;s Up Bharat][1], in Hauz Khas Village to talk about the challenges of combining media and technology in India.

Nikhil Pahwa ([@nixxin][2]), founder and publisher of digital analysis site [MediaNama][3], said he&#8217;s looking for people to take a closer look at ways to organize big data. He also suggested creating tools that can track the evolution of stories and ideas in real-time.

Kushan Mitra ([@kushanmitra][4]), managing editor of digital coordination and new projects at the [Pioneer,][5] led a conversation about the need for new revenue models in the digital media space, particularly in the Indian context.

And Narendra Nag ([@narendranag][6]), general manager of [2020Social][7], talked about his experiences as a hack/hacker for the past 10 years, and the fact that both journos and techies have a lot of learn from each other&#8217;s different viewpoints.

The crowd asked questions, enjoyed free pizza and cheap beer, and decided to throw a hackathon sometime in January. A few journalists asked for more workshops in coding and tech skills, and a lot of attendees were interested in a session on how to better understand Indian consumers&#8217; digital behavior.

A good conversation and a great launch event that was also covered in [The Sunday Guardian][8] (New Delhi). For more info, check out this [article][9].
