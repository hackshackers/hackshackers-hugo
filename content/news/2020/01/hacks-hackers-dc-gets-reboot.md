**Worth a read:**

* Google’s [Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/) tool added [a few new features](https://blog.google/products/search/discovering-millions-datasets-web/) like being able to filter by data type, see maps for geographic data and see whether the dataset is free from its source or not (Google)
* [Pandas’ new 1.0 release](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3513440/pandas-10-brings-big-breaking-changes.html) will require Python 3.6.1 or higher to run and comes with several updates such as the addition of a universal missing data-type value (Infoworld)
* Journalism’s been going thru a lot of transformation as an industry in the U.S. the past few years and is only expected to change more, so NiemanLab’s Newsonomics’ Ken Doctor outlined [20 predictions for the news business](https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/01/newsonomics-here-are-20-epiphanies-for-the-news-business-of-the-2020s/) in the 2020s (NiemanLab)
