**Worth a read:**

* Some of the most shared COVID-19-related misinformation across Europe include cures/remedies and 5G conspiracy theories. Read about this study and [other recent fake news news](https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/07/why-do-people-share-misinformation-about-covid-19-partly-because-theyre-distracted/) (Nieman Lab)
* Objectivity, or remaining neutral, is often heralded as a principle of journalism, but it can often [shut out minority voices and experiences](https://theobjective.substack.com/p/objectivity-and-the-scientific-method) in journalism (The Objective)
* An economics professor collected traffic data from cities across the U.S. since stay-at-home orders were issued. He [visualized the drop in vehicle collisions](https://medium.com/nightingale/visualizing-the-collapse-in-traffic-collisions-during-stay-at-home-orders-7c13a3642af8) with Tableau and wrote a walk through on how to replicate it (Tomas Dvorak)
