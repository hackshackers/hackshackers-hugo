  * [Miami][10] and [IRE][11] are holding their regular weekly open labs

**Group spotlight:**

[Birmingham, UK][12], recently rebooted after a few months off, and co-organizer [Maria Crosas][13] is tyring to introduce a variety of advanced and beginner concepts in a variety of meetup types. Just last week they tackled text analysis, Tableau and Telegram in a series of [lightning talks][14].

> &#8220;If you are tackling a topic that requires some level from the attendees, make it clear on the meetup page,&#8221; Crosas said. &#8220;However, if you are bringing a particular speaker because of their background, try to bring new and different approaches that would suit the interest of the attendees and will not bore or overwhelm them.&#8221;
