We&#8217;re midway through the coldest months &#8211; unless, of course, you live on the southern hemisphere &#8211; and techs and reporters are burrowing into projects or warm coats, or both. [Montreal][1], who we [featured in October][2], met for a [Pandas and D3 party][3] last week. Check out the group spotlight for how organizers in Quebec have been experimenting with their events.

**Group spotlight:**

[Roberto Rocha][4], one of the organizers of [Hacks/Hackers Montreal][1], said the group has been experimenting with meetup formats in order to make it easiest on organizers.

> &#8220;We&#8217;re still figuring out the best way to organize events, if it&#8217;s by delegating tasks, or letting organizers do things their way. We&#8217;re also experimenting with the format: short presentations followed by netowrking time, or workshops/demos. No major conclusions to share so far… But we always get 20-30 people at our events, which is pretty good.&#8221;
