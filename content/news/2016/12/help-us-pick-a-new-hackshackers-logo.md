It&#8217;s a new month, hacks and hackers, and if you&#8217;ve been reading this a while, you know that means one thing: a Hacks/Hackers [global call][1]. Check out the [agenda][2] to see what we&#8217;ll be chatting about.

If you can&#8217;t make it, please take this super short (i.e., four-question) [survey][3] to give us some feedback on a new logo:

**The week ahead:**

  * Hacks/Hackers is holding its [December open call][2]

  * Johannesburg is [drinking in some city budgets][5]
  * Montreal is [demonstrating Pandas and D3][6]
  * New Orleans holding a [hackathon planning party][7]

  * Madrid is holding a [data journalism workshop][10]

**Group spotlight:**

[Taipei][14], the recently-founded first group in Taiwan, is holding its [second meetup][4] tomorrow, spreading the Github gospel to the journalists of Taiwan. They&#8217;ve already scheduled their [third][15], which will tackle immersive storytelling.

Organizers Silva Shih and Kirby Wu have been posting and communicating on a variety of channels, including [Github][16], [Facebook][17] and [their own website][18]. Silva said Facebook was the most successful platform so far for communicating with members, while Github and Slack are more useful for communicating between organizers.

> &#8220;Since Taiwan is the most active Facebook users in the world, the answer is no surprise. But I&#8217;d say twitter has influence as well because it has regional visibility and the influence among the English speaking world. We will keep these two as the main broadcasting channels at the same time.&#8221;
