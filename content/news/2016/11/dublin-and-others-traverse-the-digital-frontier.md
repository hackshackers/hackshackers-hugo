Greetings, hacks and hackers. By the time you read this next newsletter, the American president will have been chosen (finally), so let&#8217;s take a look at what other countries are up to in the meantime.

Hacks/Hackers [Dubli][1]n is promoting the [Investigative Journalism on the Digital Frontier Conference][2] taking place in Ireland, but they&#8217;re not the only ones pushing digital boundaries this weekend. [Buenos Aires][3], a veritable hotbed of hackathons, is holding its [first hackathon][4] on &#8220;institutional violence,&#8221; a threat to human rights in Latin America and everywhere.

  * South Wales is holding its [first event][8]

**Group spotlight:**

[Taipei][9] went a pretty ambitious route with its very [first meetup][10] last month: they held a QGIS workshop with two instructors and a pretty full turnout

Hacks/Hackers groups are always striving to find the best way to communicate with members and organize events. For their part, co-organizers [Silva Shih][11] and [Kirby Wu][12] made a variety of online homes for the group, including a [Twitter][13], [website][9] and [Github][14]. Future months will hopefull indicate which are the most useful and popular.
