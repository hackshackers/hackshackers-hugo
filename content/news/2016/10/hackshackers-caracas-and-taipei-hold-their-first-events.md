Greetings, hacks and hackers! There&#8217;s been significant interest in starting new Hacks/Hackers groups from North America to Latin America to Asia over the past few months. One of the newest members of the family, [Caracas][1], held their first event last weekend: [#DataYTequeños][2] (cheesy sticks):

**Group spotlight:**

The [brand new group in Caracas][1], Venezuela, got off to a booming start last weekend. More than 40 people showed up to [a casual celebration of data and tequeños][8] &#8211; Venezuelan cheesy bread sticks. Organizer [Katherine Pennacchio][9] had a hard time estimating how many people would attend, and said picking a venue to fit the crowd was important.

> &#8220;And try to find an sponsor to be able to get free drinks or snacks. If not, give the option to buy drinks or food. Informality sometimes is good.&#8221;
