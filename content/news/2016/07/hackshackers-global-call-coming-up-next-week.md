Welcome to July, hacks and hackers! In the first half of 2016, H/H groups held nearly 100 meetups in dozens of cities. We also held seven [Connect events][1] from San Francisco to London, with another coming up in [Toronto in a couple months][2].

**The week ahead:**

  * [Miami][4] is holding OpenHack Miami
  * [IRE][5] is meeting for its regular open lab
  * Hacks/Hackers is holding its [global monthly call][3]

**Group spotlight:**

[London][6] held its [June meetup last week][7], looking at polling data just before the Europe-shaking Brexit vote. The London meetups draw huge crowds of up to 200 people a month, so the organizers built a list of tasks ahead of time.
