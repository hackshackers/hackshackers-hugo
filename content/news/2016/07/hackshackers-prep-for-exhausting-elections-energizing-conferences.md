News last week was dominated by fallouts of the [Brexit vote][1], attempted [Turkish coup][2] and spread of the [Zika virus][3]. News in the U.S., however, was dominated as it always is these days: by Donald Trump and his political party last week, and Hillary Clinton and her party this week.

**Week ahead:**

  * [Miami][4] and [IRE][5] are holding their regular weekly open labs
  * Tokyo is tackling A[rtificial Intelligence][6]
  * Brisbane is debuting a sneak peek at the [upcoming Storyology conference][7]
  * Uruguay is discussing [recyclable data projects][8]

**Chapter spotlight:**

[Hacks/Hackers Nairobi][9] met this month for [an open government session][10] in conjunction with the [Kenya Open Data Initiative][11]. Organizer [Serah Njambi Rono][12] said the group strives to hold meetups monthly, prioritizing regular events over finding a specific topic to talk about. Topics can vary, she said, but what&#8217;s important is that it&#8217;s a cohesive, active group.

> &#8220;Setting dates is where the hard work is, so it is easier to plan for meetups every quarter, half or annually if you can. This way, you are able to commit to regular meetups throughout the year.&#8221;

Attendee [Prestone Adie][13] posted [an update][14] on the [H/H blog][15], taking a look at Kenya&#8217;s 6-year-old public information law and well it has been implemented so far.
