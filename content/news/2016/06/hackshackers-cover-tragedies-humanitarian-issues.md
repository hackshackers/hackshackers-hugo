Welcome to the weekend, hacks and hackers. The media world, and the rest of the world, was rocked by news of the largest mass shooting in U.S. history. Poynter [wrote an article][1] on how the Orlando Sentinel, which has had two-thirds of its staff cut over the years, covered one of the most intense and devastating events in its history. The New York Times [made an animated presentation][2] of how its design and publication of the news changed as the story evolved.
