**Group spotlight**:

London hosted [an enormous Connect event][8] last weekend. More than 100 entrepreneurs and mentors gathered to kickstart media startups. Nick Duxbury wrote up his observations [on Medium][9], expressing his surprise at how entrepreneurial journalists were.

> “No hacks I spoke with talked about money. Some didn’t mention tech. Most seemed focused on finding ways to viably produce high quality journalism of social importance (notably \*not\* necessarily popular content) without [commercial compromises][10].”
