Get ready, hacks and hackers: there are meetups on every continent of the world this week (not counting Antarctica). Not to mention the [HHBA Media Party][1], the biggest Hacks/Hackers event in the world.

{{< youtube pTp3iSgBgIw >}}

The Media Party will bring thousands of hackers, technologists, journalists and media leaders to determine the future of media in Latin America. If you&#8217;re attending, don&#8217;t miss the Hacks/Hackers [organizers breakfast][2] on Saturday morning.

**The week ahead:**

  * Bogota is hacking education in Colombia with [#HackealaEducacion][3]
  * Singapore is throwing a [launch party for Viz.sg][4], a new country-wide dataviz portal
  * Brisbane is taking a look at new ways to [use geodata][5]
  * London is hosting its [summer picnic][6] in Regents Park
  * [Miami][7] and [IRE][8] are holding their regular weekly open labs
  * Buenos Aires is holding its huge annual [Media Party][9]
  * Johannesburg is sponsoring another installment of [#HacktheConstitution][10]

**Group spotlight:**

[#HacktheConstitution][11], a series of hackathons that started in Johannesburg in May, was named one of Africa&#8217;s most innovative tech projects [by The Guardian][12]. [Serah Njambi Rono][13], one of the main organizers for [Hacks/Hackers Africa][14], said timing has been important when it comes to getting people to show up or follow along from afar.

> &#8220;It is important to set up meetups with the community in mind. Late evenings during the week or mid-mornings on Saturdays are pretty ace to work with &#8211; that way you get more people at the physical meetups and the rest who can&#8217;t make it are able to follow via live-tweets (since they are probably sitting in traffic or scrolling through their phones after work).&#8221;
