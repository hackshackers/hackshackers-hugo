Welcome to August, hacks and hackers! Two big events our cresting our (southern) horizon this month: [Storyology][1], Australia&#8217;s biggest journalism and storytelling festival, is next week, and [Brisbane][2] held a [preview][3] while [Sydney][4] is taking the [post-party][5] honors.

And of course [Hacks/Hackers Buenos Aires][6] is prepping for its annual [Media Party][7], the largest Hacks/Hackers event in the world. Jump to the end of this newsletter for even more events coming up in September.

**The week ahead:**

  * Sydney is talking about bots at its [Storyology afterparty][5]
  * [Miami][8] is holding its regular OpenHack Miami
  * [IRE][9] in Missouri is holding its weekly meeting
  * Berlin is [hosting][10] London&#8217;s own Sarah Marshall
  * Africa is holding [#HacktheConstitution][11] in Johannesburg

**Chapter spotlight:**

The [Hacks/Hackers Africa][12] chapter in Kenya has been consistently collaborating with [Code for Africa][13], thanks to double agent [Serah Njambi Romo][14], who heads both H/H and CfA in Nairobi. She said holding H/H meetups in the same venue as CfA&#8217;s Civic Labs has helped keep the two groups organized and in contact with one another.

> &#8220;We planned for meetup dates well in advance (at the beginning of the year) and booked the space for all these dates then. In case there&#8217;s need to push the meetup date, as sometimes happens due to unavoidable circumstances, we let them know at least a week or two in advance.&#8221;
