**The week ahead:**

  * Nairobi is hearing from [the Kenya journalists][3] who worked on the #PanamaPapers project
  * Paris is also featuring #PanamaPapers journalists [from France and Europe][4]
  * Brisbane is holding a workshop on [finding stories in huge amounts of text][5]

  * [Miami][7] and [IRE][8]’s weekly labs will be open for business
  * Vienna is hosting speakers from [Google News Lab and OpenDataCity][9]
  * Barcelona is teaching [R for Dummies][10]

**Chapter spotlight:**

[Hacks/Hackers Munich][11] (München in German) invited local startup founders to [intro and demo their apps][12] &#8211; one for searching government requests and one for linking segments of data in the form of text. Co-organizer [Bernd Oswald][13] said diversity in both speakers and organizers has helped their chapter appeal to a large number of attendees.

> “We are three organizers and discuss in a slack channel about speakers and locations. We usually try to offer three speakers, one from journalism, one from coding and one from design, to make the H/H meetups appealing for people from all of these branches.
>
> From time to time we are trying to invite big names from famous media in Munich, maybe this will work in our next meeting. One of the speakers &#8211; Maxi from kleineanfragen &#8211; approached us and asked, whether he could give a speech at the next H/H meeting.”
