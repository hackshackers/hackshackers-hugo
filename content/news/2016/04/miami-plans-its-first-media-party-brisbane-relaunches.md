Happy Friday, hacks and hackers! I thought about putting an April Fool’s joke in here, but don’t worry. I wouldn’t do that to you.

Before we see what the groups are up to, I want to bring your attention to the [Website Action Group][1]’s Request for Interest for developing and designing a brand new website for [www.hackshackers.com][2].

Interested parties should [read the RFI][3] and submit their proposals to <info@hackshackers.com> by April 11, 2016. Questions and comments regarding the RFP can be addressed to the Website Action Committee via [GitHub][4].

**The week ahead:**

  * Miami is holding its own [Media Party][5], inspired by the one in Buenos Aires
  * Singapore is starting a monthly series of [Micro Hack Mondays][6]
  * [Miami][7] and [IRE][8] are holding their regular weekly open labs
  * Toronto is featuring some developers who will share [newsroom tools][9]
  * Munich will [showcase two tools][10], kleineAnfragen and KontextR
  * Halifax will tackle [how to visualize big data][11]
  * Buenos Aires is hosting a discussion on [virtual reality][12]

And last but not least, the [Hacks/Hackers global open call][13] will take place next Tuesday, April 5, at 1600 UTC. There are options for joining online, dialing in from outside the U.S., and simply following along on [the notepad][14]. Tune in!

**Group spotlight:**

[Brisbane, Australia][15], held [a showcase last week][16] featuring work by not just a graphics designer, but also its own members. Co-organizer [Simon Elvery][17] said committing to a monthly meetup schedule has helped the group re-launch this year.

> ”It&#8217;s really helpful to have shared responsibility for organising them and also that one organiser is an academic at one of Brisbane&#8217;s biggest journalism schools (Daniel Angus) while the other (me) works for the News Digital division of the national broadcaster (the ABC).”
