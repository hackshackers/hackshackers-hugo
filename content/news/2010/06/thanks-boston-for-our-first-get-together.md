Thank you everyone who turned out for the first Hacks/Hackers gathering in Boston! We had a great crowd that mixed with attendees from the Knight Foundation&#8217;s conference on the Future of News Civic Media, with people from local news organizations like [The Boston Globe and Boston.com][1], the [Nieman Journalism Lab][2] and also startups like [pinyadda][3].
