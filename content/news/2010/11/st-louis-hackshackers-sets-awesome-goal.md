The first St. Louis group meet-up was a great success. 

Fifteen hacks and hackers met for happy hour last Thursday, and expectations are high. When asked &#8220;Hacks/Hackers should \___\____,&#8221; the overwhelming answer was &#8220;be awesome.&#8221; (There was also a vote for &#8220;be pretty.&#8221; We&#8217;re going to try for both.)

Participants are already talking about ways to work with data. In December, we hope to join several St. Louis tech groups for a bowling outing.
