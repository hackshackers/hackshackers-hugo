After an hour of socializing, Jennifer 8. Lee, who came down from New York for the event, explained the details of this year’s Knight News Challenge, a grant competition for open-source news and information projects in geographic communities that gives away up to $5 million a year.

Then, [Ian Bogost][1], a researcher and Digital Media professor at Georgia Tech, talked about [Newsgames][2], an effort to understand the relationship between news and video games that received funding from the Knight Foundation three years ago, and The Cartoonist, a project that will develop a free tool that creates interactive, cartoon-like current event games that Bogost won a News Challenge grant for in 2010 with [Michael Mateas][3].

During the Q&A a number of topics were discussed, like whether one can submit a proposal that builds on previous winning projects (the answer is yes &#8211; PRX was a 210 winner that&#8217;s building on the 2008 winner spot.us to make it work for radio for example), the fact that open streets map is something the Knight Foundation is keeping an eye on (hear that, News Challenge applicants?) and why legacy media has such a hard time innovating (for example, the biggest obstacles in the way of more gaming in media is inertia, process and organizational politics).
