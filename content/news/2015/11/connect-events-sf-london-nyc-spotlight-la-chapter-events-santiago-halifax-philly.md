**Until then…**

The week ahead:

  * Hacks/Hackers **Vancouver** holds its [inaugural media startup showcase][5].
  * The **São Paulo** chapter [discusses infographics][6] with Beatriz Blanco at its next gathering.  
  * Hacks/Hackers **Santiago** hosts [a day-long event][7] about using public government spending data. 
  * In **New York**, the chapter holds [lightning talks and panel discussion][8] on “the challenges of encouraging civil discourse: the product decisions, the engineering challenges and the whole crazy ball of wax that is human conversation.”
  * Hacks/Hackers **London**’s [November meetup][9] includes hearing from Buzzfeed UK editor-in-chief Janine Gibson. 
  * As part of the WordCamp US Community Summit, Hacks/Hackers **Philly **is [co-hosting a meetup][10] about the intersections of WordPress and media. 
  * Another new chapter launching (woohoo!) &#8211; this one in [Halifax, Nova Scotia][11]. (Now try saying “Hacks/Hackers **Halifax”** five times fast.)

**Job openings:**

None to report this week. If you have an open position, send it our way!

**Chapter spotlight: Hacks/Hackers Los Angeles**

The LA chapter began its reboot just a few weeks ago, and already held a great event where people from the L.A. Times data desk talked through their process for a few projects. You can see the slides or watch a few videos from the event (thanks to Ben Welsh for sharing). 

  * Slides: [bit.ly/hh_latdatadesk][12]

**Call to action: **

In honor of U.S. Thanksgiving, today’s call to action is simply this: Say thanks to whoever makes your Hacks/Hackers experience wonderful. Maybe that’s an organizer, or a coworker who invited you to your first event, or someone who always shows up smiling. Our Hacks/Hackers community is made up of thousands of thoughtful, dedicated people, and thanks to each of you for being a part of it.

See you next week.
