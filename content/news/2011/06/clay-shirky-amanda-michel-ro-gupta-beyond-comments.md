Last week was a bit of a blur: after meeting with the [Chicago Tribune News Applications team][1], and [descending into the Tribune dungeon][2] for an [evening of brainstorming][3] with the local Hacks/Hackers group, I was off to New York for the Hacks/Hackers NYC “[Beyond Comments: Discuss, brainstorm with Shirky, Michel, Gupta][4]” event at NYU’s Tisch School for the Arts (home of the [ITP program][5]).

Sadly, I didn’t manage to capture [Clay Shirky’s][6] talk where he touched on some of his recent research into online conversations. (If you recorded it, or have links to his recent writings on the topic, please pop a note into the comments below!)

By the time that [Ro Gupta][7] of [Disqus][8] took the stage, I was able to get my act together and start recording. His talk in two parts:

Next up was [Amanda Michel][9] of [ProPublica][10] who spoke to her experiences in online community organizing, and how those skills translate into the new kinds of journalism being pioneered at ProPublica.
